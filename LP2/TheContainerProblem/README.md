<h1>The container Problem</h1>
<h2>What is that?</h2>
We have a water container, it stores an amount of water, we can add/remove water from a container and see the amount of water in the container. Very simple for now, but
i have another water container that i want to connect to the first container or to another one with a pipe and then the water is distribuited among the containers equally.
<h2>Speed or Memory</h2>
In this folder you will find different resolution of this problem:
<ul>
<li>Speed We solve the problem considering the best performance in terms of time</li>
<li>Memory we solve the problem trying to occupy less memory as possible </li>
</ul>
<h2>Has memory one solution?</h2>
No, but if we dive more in this type of solution we lost all of the object oriented benefits and the code is very twisted cause we must work with array, index ecc...

>If we want to do this we can code in C.     cit. *All coders out there*

Have fun!
