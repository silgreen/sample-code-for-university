# sample-code-for-university

i'm studying Programming Language I right now, and i feel very confortable with Java
and Object Oriented Programming. There are a lot of stuff out there, i want more knowledge :)

This repo exists because:
<ol>
<li>I need a backup for my source files to swap between different devices</li>
<li>I want to improve my english skills</li>
<li>I want to improve my Version Control skills</li>
</ol>

During this course i have encountered the functional Language ML and the logic one Prolog.
I will add soon snippets of code written in this two languages.

You can find source files of examples and exercises with solutions and exaplanation in comments. I hope that will be usefull for anyone
